# CampQuest United States
This is my first full stack CRUD project that allows users to view, post, edit, delete, and leave reviews on the campgrounds. 
<br><br>
<b>Features that I added/will be added on top of Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp: </b>
<br>

1.**[NPS API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/guides.htm)** - I integrated real campgrounds in the United States using an API.<br>
2. **☀️light and 🌙dark mode** - I used JS DOM Manipulation, localStorage, and Cookies to implement this themed feature.<br>
3. **🌳My campgrounds** - This feature allows users to show the campgrounds they uploaded to YelpCamp! <br>
4. **📄pagination feature** - I also used DOM Manipulation, cookies, and Mongoose to implement pagination. This augments the performance by loading only few datas the user wants rather than loading a whole single resource.<br>
5. 🔍**Filter Campgrounds Feature** - allows users to look for campgrounds located on a certain state.
